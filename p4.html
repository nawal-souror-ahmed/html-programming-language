Characteristics of a programming Language: - –
 *A  programming language must be simple, easy to learn and use, have good readability and human recognizable. 
 *Abstraction is a must-have Characteristics for a programming language in which ability to define the complex structure and then its degree of usability comes.
. *A portable programming language is always preferred
 Programming language’s efficiency must be high so that it can be easily converted into a machine code and executed consumes little space in memory.
 *A  programming language should be well structured and documented so that it is suitable for application development. 
 *Necessary tools for development, debugging, testing, maintenance of a program must be provided by a programming language. 
*A  programming language should provide single environment known as Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
 *A  programming language must be consistent in terms of syntax and semantics.

Types of Programming Language-
-: There are three types of programming language
2Assembly language(Low-– 1-Machine language (Low-level language)
3 High- level language–level language)
 Low-level languages are closer to the language used By a computer, while high-level language are closer to human language.
1) Machine Language:-
*Machine language is a collection of binary digits or
bits that the computer reads and interprets.
 *Machine languages are the only languages
understood by computers.
 *While easily understood by computers, machine
languages are almost impossible for humans to use
because they consist entirely of numbers.
2) Assembly Language:-
 A program written in assembly language consists of a *
series of instructions mnemonics that correspond to a 
stream of executable instructions, when translated by 
an assembler, that can be loaded into memory and 
executed.
 Assembly languages use keywords and symbols *
much like English, to form a programming language 
but at the same time introduce a new problem.
Example: -
1011000001100001 –: Machine language  
–: Assembly language
mov a1, #061h 
– :Meaning
Move the hexadecimal value 61 (97 decimal) into 
the processor register named "a1"
3) High Level Language:-
 High-level languages allow us to write computer *
code using instructions resembling everyday spoken 
language.
Programs written in a high-level language need to *
be translated into machine language before they 
can be executed.
Examples of High-level Language:-
C - C++ - JAVA- BASIC -COBOL -PASCAL -PHYTON ADA
