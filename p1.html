At the beginning of this research, programming should be defined as it is defined as the process of writing instructions and commands for a computer or other device, to direct and inform it about how to deal with data or to carry out a specific verb, and the programming process follows rules specific to the language chosen by the programmer.   
The programming language is a set of commands, written according to a set of rules determined by the language, and then these commands go through several stages until they are executed on the computer.  Programming languages, based on their proximity to human languages, are divided into a high-level language (close to the language humans understand) such as Java Java C and a low-level language (as Assembly language which is close to machine language).  Sometimes it is divided according to the purposes of this language, there are languages designed to work on certain devices, such as a company producing a computer or a central processor, and providing it with a usage guide containing the commands that are executed on it, and there are other languages that work independently of the machine  That is, it operates within a virtual machine, such as Java.
Each language has its own characteristics that distinguish it from the other and make it suitable in varying degrees. Each type of program.  Programming languages also have common characteristics and common boundaries, given that all of these languages are designed to interact with computers.
